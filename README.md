# Brevoza CMS
---
A Next JS web app that will read the brevoza.config.yml file of a GitHub repo and display an editor specific to that schema to create/edit/delete items in a collection.  

you must install the github app brevoza-cms (https://github.com/apps/brevoza-cms) to your account and allow it access to your repo you want connected.


if i want the github project https://github.com/brevoza/jonny-jackson-projects edited, i need to go to 
https://brevoza-cms.vercel.app/brevoza/jonny-jackson-projects


```
cd brevoza-cms
npm run dev
```





eventually, ill need to list on marketplace https://github.com/settings/apps/brevoza-cms and go over permissions
